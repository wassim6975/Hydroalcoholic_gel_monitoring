# Information Hydroalcoholic Gel 

## Informations

This project allows the monitoring of information on connected hydroalcoholic gel devices. The user receives a SMS with information allowing the terminal to be identified in the form:
`{\"numberOfUsages\":240, \"batteryLevel\":4500\}`

Then depending on the device, the server with a RESTFul API will give us the remaining battery level of the devise as well as the remaining level of hydroalcoholic gel device.
This application also offers to send a sms to ourself in order to test the good reception of the sms as well as the collection of data.

This project is part of the school work.
